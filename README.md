# UNIHACK2019
As you're all aware, there was a world-wide climate strike last Friday in over 100 countries. Where more than 1.5 million students took part in the strike with 150, 000 from Australia alone. It ranges from primary schoolers to secondary schoolers - so why did they go on strike?

It is because they feel disenfranchised and disempowered by the current system. They feel that they can't make a significant positive impact to climate change policy unless they all banded together in a concerted effort. Think about it, they can't even vote yet. There is a whole generation of customers who are becoming more and more concious about climate change, which also includes being more selective about who they shop with or what brands they trust.

The app works by gamifying the user experience to encourage them to shop in a more eco-friendly manner by offering reward points for each purchase with eco-friendly restaurants or brands, therefore encouraging their decision to shop in a way which all together, will make a difference in society.

This concerted effort will end up supporting businesses who are already eco-friendly as well as also encouraging businesses to be more sustainable if they want to tap into this emerging market or risk falling behind.


**Why would people support this start-up?**
- Sustainability is not just a growing trend, it is becoming a way of living, and more and more companies and countries agreeing to this culture shift
- This app 

**Why do businesses want to use the app?**
- Encourages businesses to be sustainable
- Fulfil KPIs
- Increase their customers/image by associating themselves with us
- Sustainable-focused customers are increasing with no sign of stopping, if businesses want to tap into this as well as not fall behind in the change in consumer culture, they will want to change their habits to appeal to the consumer

**Why would customers want to use the app?**
- Many people feel disenfranchised that they are unable to make a significant impact with the climate change movement. That no matter how hard you try, that you aren't making a difference in the sea that is 7 billion people.
- Take the world-wide climate change strike as an example.
- But exactly like the world-wide school strike, where the young generation felt that the only way they could make a difference in the world is to all take a day out of their education to express their dissatisfaction to the people who have the power to make a change.
- **Power back to the individual**
- As we all know, there was a climate change strike (temperatures are rising each year, Arctic is almost gone)
- Making meaningful business decisions about who they buy products from

Extra features for scalability:
- loot box to further the gamifying experience. If we can turn it into a game, it will encourage the earning of points.
- rank of most environmentally friendly in Melbourne, then compare to Sydney, compare to US etc.
- rank businesses to provide incentive for businesses to be more sustainable
- have a pop up saying "You purchased a vegan schnitzel, by not choosing to have a chicken schnitzel, you saved X carbon emissions, Y Litres of water". 
- percentage system rating how many of the organics is the menu
- Have a rating like in zomato
