**Why would people support this start-up?**
- Sustainability is not just a growing trend, it is becoming a way of living, and more and more companies and countries agreeing to this culture shift
- This app 


**Why do businesses want to use the app?**
- Encourages businesses to be sustainable
- Fulfil KPIs
- Increase their customers/image by associating themselves with us
- Sustainable-focused customers are increasing with no sign of stopping, if businesses want to tap into this as well as not fall behind in the change in consumer culture, they will want to change their habits to appeal to the consumer

**Why would customers want to use the app?**
- Many people feel disenfranchised that they are unable to make a significant impact with the climate change movement. That no matter how hard you try, that you aren't making a difference in the sea that is 7 billion people.
- Take the world-wide climate change strike as an example.
- But exactly like the world-wide school strike, where the young generation felt that the only way they could make a difference in the world is to all take a day out of their education to express their dissatisfaction to the people who have the power to make a change.
- **Power back to the individual**
- As we all know, there was a climate change strike (temperatures are rising each year, Arctic is almost gone)
- Making meaningful business decisions about who they buy products from
